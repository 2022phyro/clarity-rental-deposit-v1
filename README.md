# Rental Deposit Smart Contract

This smart contract implements an automated rental deposit system on the Stacks blockchain. It allows:

- Landlords to create rental agreements with specified deposit amounts
- Tenants to securely pay deposits that are held in the contract
- Landlords to return deposits when the rental agreement ends
- Automatic tracking of rental status and deposit amounts

The contract ensures trust and transparency in the rental deposit process by removing the need for third-party escrow services.
